(formerly called Tech Support Cheat Sheet)¹

Dear various parents, grandparents, co-workers, and other ‘not computer people’.

Tech Support Helper is a simple, interactive web app that guides users through troubleshooting technical issues step-by-step.

It’s like having that “IT person” with you who gently steers you toward the light at the end of the technical tunnel.
